\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
    We describe the experience acquired during the integration of the
    \texttt{tsi148} driver
    into the main Linux kernel tree. The benefits (and some of the drawbacks) for
    long-term software maintenance are analysed, the most immediate one being the
    support and quality review added by an enormous  community of skilled
    developers. Indirect consequences are also analysed, and these are no less
    important: a serious impact in the style of the development process, the use of
    cutting edge tools and technologies supporting development, the adoption of the
    very strict standards enforced by the Linux kernel community, etc. These
    elements were also exported to the hardware development process in our section
    and we will explain how they were used with a particular example in mind: the
    development of the FMC family of boards following the Open Hardware philosophy,
    and how its architecture must fit the Linux model. This delicate interplay of
    hardware and software architectures is a perfect showcase of the benefits we
    get from  the strategic decision of having our drivers integrated in the
    kernel.  Finally, the case for a whole family of CERN-developed drivers for
    data acquisition models, the prospects for its integration in the kernel, and
    the adoption of a model parallel to Comedi, is also taken as an example of how
    this model will perform in the future.

\section{TSI148 DRIVER INTEGRATION IN THE KERNEL}
\subsection{Rationale}
The VME bus is a central component of the Controls System at CERN. We 
rely on 1140 FECs (Front End Computers), 710 of which are VME crates
with SBC (Single Board Computers). A process of renovation is in course,
involving the migration from 
\begin{Itemize}
\item CES RIO2/RIO3 SBCs with PowerPC CPUs runing LynxOS (around 605
    crates by August 2010), to
\item MEN-A20 SBCs with Intel CPUs running  a real-time enabled Linux
    (around 105)
\end{Itemize}

The MEN-A20 SBC incorporates a TSI148 VME-to-PCI-X bridge chip.
To support the functionalities required, and for maximum backward
comaptibility with the legacy CES API, a device driver was developed 
at CERN group BE/CO in spring 2009. Clearly, this is a strategical
component of the controls system: every VME device relies on the
provided programming interface to the VME bus. The CERN-developed driver
offers, therefore, a CES compatibility API to ease the transition during
the renovation process, and a new API more similar to common practice
in the Linux kernel.

After a period of validation and improvement taking place during 2010,
the strategic decision was taken to submit the driver for
inclusion in the mainline Linux kernel tree. The ongoing process, started
beginning 2011 and in course of completion, is described in the following
sections.

\subsection{Benefits}

There are many reasons that make the insertion of code in the mainline
kernel a desirable target.

\begin{Itemize}
\item Smoother maintenance in the (rather frequent) event of kernel API
    modification.
\item Very strict process of peer review of the code by knowledgeable
    and specialized maintainers.
\item Widespread distribution of the codebase, which can then be
    enhanced and get contributions by many other members of the community.
\item Input from the topmost experts in the field.
\item Best practice and use of the best possible tools enforced by
    the community.
\item Avoidance of suboptimal, ad hoc solutions in favor of the
    best ones from the technical point of view.
\item Faster cycle of bug fixes.
\item Being able to drive a critical hardware component with software
    in the stock kernel, with no local, idiosyncratic modifications.
    \label{stock}
\item Last but not least, contributing back in return to the many
    benefits the FOSS comunity gives us
\end{Itemize}

It is an interesting fact that~\ref{stock}, which in the beginning
looked a
far-fetched reason for undertaking this project, turned out to be more
relevant as it evolved. Renovated FECs at CERN controls system
are diskless machines, booting a custom kernel carefully configured and
patched to match local needs. Though this kernel is essentially a stock,
mainline tree from \url{http://kernel.org} with a very reduced 
configuration, the \verb|CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT|
patch set applied, plus many required local
tweaks, maintaining this system soon becomes a full time job requiring
great expertise and care, given its radical impact in the controls
system stability. Relying on a stock kernel from a main
distribution alleviates this dependency on a single, dedicated
maintainer, and pushes strongly towards having the \texttt{tsi148}
driver integrated upstream.

\subsection{Drawbacks}

Some of the drawbacks herewith enumerated will be elaborated further in
the description of the integration process, but we summarize here the
most important ones.

\begin{Itemize}
\item It's hard. One should be ready for the peculiar culture of the
    Linux Kernel Mailing List.
\item Design, APIs and coding practice that is customary or simply 
    acceptable locally must be adapted or rebuilt to comply with the
    strict standards of the Linux kernel community. The morale
    is that the end product will almost certainly be different from what one
    initially would settle for (but will also certainly be better).
\item One must be prepared to compromise. The most practical,
    short-lived solution might not be the technically perfect one kernel
    maintainers aim at.
\item Maintainers are occasionally hard to deal with.
\item The process may be long.
\item Gradual changes are likely to be better accepted that big chunks
    of code submitted out of the blue.  
\item Having a history of prior contributions gives more respectability
    and ease of acceptance.
\end{Itemize}

\subsection{The process}

Submission of source code for acceptance in the kernel is done by means
of patches subject to a process of peer review before acceptance. The
reviews are sometimes daunting, and much edition and re-submissions can
result. This process of strict code review is another good practice our
team adopted for its development process. The benefits are obvious.

Our fist attempt of integration of the \verb|tsi148| driver
was initiated in mid-2010 by one of the authors (Emilio Garc\'ia
Cota). 

By that time, a \verb|tsi148| driver had recently been admitted in the
\texttt{staging/} area of the kernel, and was maintained by Martyn Welch. This
driver brought a temptative support for the VME bus that covered
two VME-to-PCI bridges:
\begin{Itemize}
\item the Tundra Universe chips, with work derived from VMELinux by John
Huggins and Michael Wyrick.
\item the Tundra TSI148 chip, inspired in the above.
\end{Itemize}

   \centering
   \includegraphics*[width=80mm]{wishbone-enum.eps}
   \caption{Wishbone bus driver architecture}
   \label{wishbone-enum}
\end{figure}

The set of patches initially submitted provided improvements in several
areas, esp. in orthodox implementation of the Linux bus/device model
concepts.
Acceptance by the maintainer was partial, and modifications related to
the device model implementation remained controversial and not accepted.

The submission was re-approached beginning 2011 by another of the
authors (Manohar Vanga). In this case, some bugs in the staging driver
were fixed, and the bulk of modifications concerning the device model
were partially acknowledged. This led to a third iteration of the
process, and the re-issue of a third patch set in August 2011. At the
time of this writing, the definitive submission and acceptance of the
last set of patches (five changesets) concerning the core device model
is in its final stage, and will be applied by the main kernel maintainer
in the next merge window.

Although the whole set of patches concerning bug
fixes and device model of the \verb|tsi148| VME bridge driver is
finally accepted, there is still a long way before reaching
the final desideratum, i.e., driving our \verb|tsi148| devices
with stock software from the mainline kernel tree.
\begin{Itemize}
\item The outstanding goal should be now getting the VME driver out
of the \verb|./staging/| tree. For that purpose, code must be worked on
(or it'll die), and set up to the highest standard of quality to be
accepted upstream.
\item There are API  incompatibilities with the driver currently used at
CERN; this implies that a transient kernel module must adapt interfaces
if driver code has to remain untouched.
\end{Itemize}

In~\cite{fpga-fmc}, a family of carrier/mezzanine boards compliant 
with the ANSI VITA~57 FMC standard~\cite{vita-fmc} is described. This kit of boards,
developed by the BE/CO Hardware and Timing section at CERN is
another case in point for the benefits of a Linux kernel-centric
approach. The hardware concept and architecture are described
in the aforementioned paper~\cite{fpga-fmc}; the key point is that the
mezzanine provides basic circuitry, and the core of the application
logic is implemented in the FPGA of the carrier board. The cores inside
this FPGA are interconnected via a Wishbone~\cite{wishbone-spec} bus.


From the software
point of view, a particular instance of this family behaves like a
PCI-to-Wishbone or VME-to-Wishbone bridge. The Wishbone bus
interconnects a set of cores providing functionalities that are either
common to the whole family of mezzanines, or specific to the application
board actually plugged in the FMC slot. We show in figure~\ref{slow-adc}
the block diagram of the FMC 100MS 14 bit ADC,
a typical example of an FPGA application comprising cores for, among
others
\begin{Itemize}
\item basic I${}^2$C interfacing to the mezzanine board
\item Wishbone mastering
\item DMA access to DDR3 memory in the carrier board
\item mezzanine-specific control logic (e.g., ADC programming/setup)
\item interrupt control
\end{Itemize}
The consequence of this modular design of the application FPGA is that
the device driver architecture reflects the structure of this set of
cores (see figure~\ref{wishbone-enum}). The driver for the carrier board
performs essentially the following basic functions
\begin{Itemize}
\item Identify the carrier board and initialize it
\item Perform a basic identification of the mezzanine(s) installed in
    the FMC slot(s), and their configured applications.
\item Load the application firmware into the carrier FPGA
\item Register a Wishbone bus with the kernel
\item Enumerate the cores in that firmware (to wit, the
    inner blocks in figure~\ref{slow-adc})
\item register the devices those cores implement and install the drivers 
    associated to them
\end{Itemize}
The process is directly implied by how the Linux kernel device
model is implemented as described in~\cite{device-model} or in chapter~14
of~\cite{rubini}. Conceptually, it amounts to the provision of a bus driver
for Wishbone, plus a PCI-to-Wishbone bridge driver for the
carrier board.

Modularity and reusability of cores and drivers are not the only
rationale behind this design. Actually, the drivers for the FMC family
are the second family of drivers planned to be integrated in the
mainline kernel. Given that boards and their applications will be
company-produced and available to a wide public (not only CERN-centric),
having their drivers and the Wishbone bus integrated is the logical step
to take. The Wishbone enumeration is made possible through the
definition of an FPGA configuration space developed
in~\cite{fpga-config-space}, that will be the basis for the integration of
all drivers of this family in the kernel.

\section{DATA ACQUISITION DRIVERS: KERNEL FRAMEWORKS}

The third family of drivers considered for integration upstream is less
homogeneous than the FMC family. The BE/CO group supports a standard kit
of hardware modules for data acquisition and general analog and digital
I/O, some of whose characteristics can be compared in
table~\ref{zio-modules}. Linux drivers for these modules were developed in
different stages of the renovation process, leading from legacy
LynxOS drivers to Linux; therefore, there is a varying degree of adherence to 
standard practice in the Linux kernel community, because of the
LynxOS coding practice formerly prevalent.

Two needs arise here clearly, in the light of our intention of having
our whole set of drivers incorporated upstream:
\begin{Itemize}
\item Proceed to a more homogeneous, Linux-only code base.
\item Provide a general framework for data acquisition and control
devices
\end{Itemize}
Concerning the latter,
there are two candidate Linux kernel frameworks:
Comedi~\cite{comedi} and IIO~\cite{iio}. Both are in
\texttt{./staging/}, and careful analysis show that they prove
insufficient for our needs. Then, the development of a more complete and
acceptable framework for industial data acquisition and analog/digital
I/O becomes part of our effort of integrating our supported
device drivers in the Linux kernel. Such a framework,
codenamed \texttt{zio}, is in its initial stage and intends to cover
all the relevant aspects, far beyond the existing frameworks. To name a
few
\begin{Itemize}
\item digital and analog input and output
\item one-shot and streaming (buffered) data acquisition or waveform play
\item resolution
\item data rate
\item buffer management and timing for streaming conversion
\item support of DMA
\item calibration, offset and gain
\item bit grouping in digital I/O
\item timestamping
\item triggering of acquisition/output
\item clean design conformant to Linux kernel practice
\end{Itemize}

At the time of this writing, beta versions of the framework software
are in development phase~\cite{zio-git}.
